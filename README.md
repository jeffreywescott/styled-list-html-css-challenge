# Styled List Challenge

For this challenge, the objective is to learn how to use CSS to style an HTML
list to create a menu-like effect.

You should only have to edit: `index.html` and `main.css`.

## Using Nitrous.io

The file editor should be pretty self explanatory.

The window at the bottom is a "Terminal" window. You'll need to start to get familiar
with these anyway, so may as well start now. When you open Nitrous.io, be sure that
you are in the `styled-list-html-css-challenge` folder. If you are not, you can use
this command:

    $ cd styled-list-html-css-challenge
    
Once you're in that folder, you can run the "web server" with this command (so that\
you can view your work):

    $ node index.js
    
After that, use the Nitrous.io `Preview --> Port 3000` menu option and you'll see the
results of what you've done.


## Hints

- read-up on HTML unordered lists
- read-up on CSS pseudo-selectors (e.g., first-child, last-child, hover)
